Melbourne Housing Data

Data has been taken from Kaggle, it is the Full version with 21 variables, link is below.

Using data from: https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market.  

Original Cleaning is in the master branch.
Separated version into houses/apartments/townhouses with graphs and normalization via log10 is in separate branches


Most up to date (4 separate sections) - Master/branch houses 3/branch graphs/ branch HouseTestAndTrain - 31/10/18

Added another section with Regression however, this time keeping building area, and year built. Due to NA values this causes a loss of additional rows, shrinking the dataset, but provides a stronger model - saved as branch - buildArea 3 - 2/11/18
